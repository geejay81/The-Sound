While creating my site, I wanted to include icons against each navbar option for aesthetic reasons, but also so that I could hide the text descriptions on small viewports.

I have used Font Awesome icons many times before, and started off by following the advice for using these icons on Next.js applications in the guide on the [Font Awesome site](https://docs.fontawesome.com/web/use-with/react/use-with) but I quickly ran in to issues when trying to also use Tailwind CSS stylings.

After some research, I found that there is a great package called [React Icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons#readme) which includes many different icon sets, one of which is the free Font Awesome library.

## Using the icons

This is a simple as importing the icon components you want from the library in your .tsx. or .jsx file, and then adding them to your returned TSX or JSX.

For example, in my application, I decided to use a separate navLinks.ts file to export an object of my navigation links, that can then be imported and looped through to generate links.

This file initially looks like below:

``` ts
export const navLinks = [
    {
        "title": "Projects",
        "url": "/projects",
        "showInNavbar": true
    },
    {
        "title": "Blog",
        "url": "/posts",
        "showInNavbar": true
    },
    {
        "title": "Games",
        "url": "/games",
        "showInNavbar": true
    },
    {
        "title": "Tools",
        "url": "/tools",
        "showInNavbar": true
    }
]
```

The first thing I did was rename this to navLinks.tsx, as it would now return an object that includes the **React Icons** components for each icon.

Now I imported the icons that I would be using in the file:

``` tsx
import { FaCookieBite, FaGamepad, FaLaptop, FaQuoteLeft, FaWrench } from "react-icons/fa";
...
```

You can see from the snippet above that I the icons are stored in a folder name 'fa' beneath the 'react-icons' folder. This 'fa' stands for Font Awesome and is where all of the components for their icons are stored, but if you have a look at this package yourselft, you will see that there are lots of different folders, each representing different icons sets from other third party vendors.

Having imported the icons that I need, I was then able to add them to my exported object.

``` tsx
...
export const navLinks = [
    {
        "title": "Projects",
        "url": "/projects",
        "showInNavbar": true,
        "icon": <FaLaptop className="inline" />
    },
    {
        "title": "Blog",
        "url": "/posts",
        "showInNavbar": true,
        "icon": <FaQuoteLeft className="inline" />
    },
    {
        "title": "Games",
        "url": "/games",
        "showInNavbar": true,
        "icon": <FaGamepad className="inline" />
    },
    {
        "title": "Tools",
        "url": "/tools",
        "showInNavbar": true,
        "icon": <FaWrench className="inline" />
    }
];
```

The attribute 'className="inline"' here is just a Tailwind CSS styling that I've included as it is required for the layout in my navbar component.

Now in the Navbar component, I can import the navLinks object and loop through it to display the links:

``` tsx
import Link from "next/link";
import logo from "../../ui/fonts/Logo";
import { navLinks } from "@/ui/navigation/data";

export default function Navbar() {

    return (
        <header className="bg-slate-700 text-white">
            <nav className="container mx-auto max-w-l flex items-center justify-between p-6">
                <div className="text-2xl md:text-3xl">
                    <Link href="/" className={logo.className}>
                        The Sound
                    </Link>
                </div>
                <div className="space-x-4">
                    {navLinks &&
                        navLinks
                            .filter((link: any) => link.showInNavbar)
                            .map((link: any) => {
                                return (
                                    <Link key={link.url} href={link.url} title={link.title} 
                                        className="inline-flex flex-row items-center space-x-2">
                                        {link.icon && link.icon}
                                        <span className="sr-only md:not-sr-only">{link.title}</span>
                                    </Link>
                                )
                            }
                        )
                    }
                </div> 
            </nav>
        </header>
    )
}

```

As you can see from the code above, all I have to do is ad \{link.icon && link.icon\} to first make sure that the icon has been provided as part of the current link that is being processed and then output the component.

## Conclusion

There may have been a number of reasons why the process suggested on the Font Awesome website didn't work for me, but I feel like even if it had work, it was still quite a bit more involved than just being able to import the icon components I need from the React Icons library and use it on the page.
