When building a new website with Next.js 14, using the App Router, I wanted to use a particular Google font for the logo in the Navbar component. 

There was quite a bit of documentation on the web, but all seemed to be related to setting a google font as the base font across all text on the site, so I decided to try and implement a function that I would import only in to the components where it was required.

## Approach

I created a Logo.ts file that exports a **NextFont** object, by calling a specific font related function. 
The file exports an object called **logo** as it is the font used for the logo in the **Navbar** component.

``` ts
// /ui/font/logo.js

import { Fredericka_the_Great } from "next/font/google";

const logo = Fredericka_the_Great({
    subsets: ['latin'],
    weight: ['400'],
    variable: '--font-fredericka'
});

export default logo;
```

This object can now be imported into the component where it is needed.

``` ts
// /components/page/Navbar.tsx
import logo from "../../ui/fonts/Logo";
...
```

The logo object will have a property called **className** that can be used to apply a class to a text element that will then apply the font to that element.

``` ts
// /components/page/Navbar.tsx
...
<Link href="/" className={logo.className}>The Sound</Link>
...
