Street Boules is a brand new sport invented by a group of friends from Crawley. It is an innovative and exciting take on traditional boules, with its own ruleset that add drama and tension.

To support the growth of the sport, the Street Boules administrator approached The Sound group of hobbyist developers to produce a website that can be used for spreading the word about the sport.

The website is built using the [Decap](https://decapcms.org) content management system with Gatsby, so that the Street Boules administrators can update the website information without needing to know how to code.

The site uses the [Bulma](https://bulma.io) CSS framework for styling, with a custom theme to reflect the Street Boules corporate brand guidelines.
